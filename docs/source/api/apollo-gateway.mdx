## `ApolloGateway`

The core class of Apollo Server's federated gateway implementation. For an
example of using `ApolloGateway`, see [Implementing a federated graph](/federation/implementing/).

### `constructor(options)`: `ApolloGateway`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the gateway.

  Supported options include:

  * `serviceList`: `ServiceDefinition[]`

    > **Do not provide this option if you are using [managed federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/platform/federation/#managed-configuration).** If you
    > are _not_ using managed federation, this option is **required**.

    An array representing the implementing services that the gateway will use to resolve incoming GraphQL operations. Each object in the array specifies the `name` and `url` of an implementing service in your federated graph. You can specify any string value for the `name` field, which is used primarily for identifying the service in log output and error messages.

    ```js{3-6}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      serviceList: [
        { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
        { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' }
      ]
    });
    ```

  * `buildService`: `(service: ServiceDefinition) => GraphQLDataSource`

    Define this function to customize your gateway's data transport to some or
    all of your data graph's implementing services.

    If you provide this function, `ApolloGateway` calls it for every
    implementing service in your data graph. The function must return a `GraphQLDataSource` object.

    The example below demonstrates adding an `x-user-id`
    HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{1-5,9-11}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    }

    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      buildService({ name, url }) {
        return new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
    });
    ```

  * `introspectionHeaders`: `{ [key: string]: string }`

    An object containing HTTP headers to include in all introspection queries
    the gateway sends to your implementing services.

    > **Note:** If you define a `buildService` function, you should specify these headers
    > in that function instead of using this option.

    ```js{3-5}
    const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
      ...
      introspectionHeaders: {
        Authorization: 'my-header'
      }
    });
    ```

  * `debug`: `Boolean`

    If `true`, the gateway logs startup messages, along with the query plan for
    each incoming request. The default value is `false`.

#### Returns

An `ApolloGateway` instance, which you then pass as the `gateway` configuration option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway: new ApolloGateway({ serviceList: [...] }),
});
```

## `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

A `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` object represents a connection between your
federated gateway and _one_ of your implementing services. You can customize
this connection in two different ways:

* Define a `willSendRequest` function that lets you modify your gateway's requests to the implementing service before they're sent.
* Define a `didReceiveResponse` function that lets you modify the implementing service's responses before the gateway passes them along to the requesting client.

### `constructor(options)`: `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`

#### Parameters

* `options`: `Object`

  An object that contains configuration options for the data source.

  Supported options include:

  * `url`: `string` _(required)_

    The implementing service's URL for sending fetch requests via HTTP.

  * `willSendRequest`: `(request: GraphQLRequest) => Promise<void>`

    Define this function to customize the structure of each fetch that's sent
    to the implementing service. The function takes both the request and
    and the context from Apollo Server as parameters.

    The example below demonstrates adding an `x-user-id`
    HTTP header to every request the gateway sends to an implementing service:

    ```js{2-4}
    class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource({
      willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
        request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', context.userId);
      }
    });
    ```

  * `didReceiveResponse`: `(response: Response, request: Request, context: TContext) => Promise<TResult>`

    Define this function to customize the gateway's behavior after completing
    a fetch to the implementing service. The function takes the request, response, and Apollo Server context as parameters, allowing you to modify any combination of the context and the final result of the fetch.

    This function must returned a parsed response body.

    ```js{2-9}
    class CookieDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
      didReceiveResponse(response, request, context) {
        const body = super.didReceiveResponse(response, request, context);
        const cookie = request.http.headers.get('Cookie');
        if (cookie) {
          context.responseCookies.push(cookie);
        }
        return body;
      }
    }
    ```
